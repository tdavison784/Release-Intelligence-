# Phase 6 decision-intel commander log

Commander: Claude Opus 5.5. Mission `MISSION.md` (product owner, 2026-10-20). Plans `PLAN-M<n>.md` are lane-safe;
gates `GATE-M<n>.md` are label-bearing and commander-only. Queue: `LEDGER.yaml`. Fleet rules: `FLEET.md`. No GLM
handoffs (every item is `providers: [claude]`).

## Decisions

- 2026-10-20 (product owner): Phase 6 continues under the decision-intel mission. "We continue using the fleet
  methodology as we have done, nothing changes in that regard." The milestone order follows mission §10, so X-0009
  (global advisories) is part of M2, not ahead of M1.
- 2026-10-20: PLAN-M1 was split into a lane-safe plan and the commander's GATE-M1 (expected outcomes and case
  facts), so the implementation lane builds generic tracing, not the answer.

## Next actions

1. Start lane `consumer` (D-0001): worktree `.claude/worktrees/p6di-consumer`, branch `p6di/consumer`, Opus.
2. On LANE DONE:
   - review for generic logic;
   - merge;
   - run GATE-M1 §2 (D-0002), score it, write M1-RESULT.md (D-0003).
